### Breathing is the very essence and source of life in our bodies.

Let's start by examining our breathe rate and its effects on our physiology. Then let's dive deep into making practical sense of data collected to find the optimal rate.

The duality of balance is expressed by the regulatory functions of the body. Maintaining a healthy balance in the body is part of homeostasis. Homeostasis is a condition in which the body's internal environment remains relatively constant within physiologic limits. It is maintained by adaptive responses. Specific control and feedback mechanisms are responsible for adjusting body systems to maintain this state. 

**The most important feedback and control mechanism is our breathing.** Rapid breathing can indicate over stress, while slow breathing can indicate calm. But what we know that breathing isn't always a reaction, but an action.  We have choice, we can breathe fast or slow if we want to. This can be used to our advantage. 

For example, the normal respiration rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 16 breaths per minute, normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute and normal blood pressure is less then 120/80 mm Hg. Occasionally those physiological rhythms can become synchronized, which improves the system’s efficiency and has great health benefits.

How and why would we want to sync our breathing rate with our heart rate?  Enter Heart Rate Variability (HRV). 

Higher heart rate variability (HRV) is more desirable because it reflects the resilience of your heart and its ability to adapt to physiological and environmental demands quickly. **“Higher levels of HRV are indicative of a healthy heart and a marker of overall healthy physiological functioning. Low HRV, or less responsiveness to physiological needs, predicts mortality and morbidity and also occurs in depression, anxiety, and chronic stress.**” 

If higher heart rate variability is so important, is there a way for us to raise it? Turns out there is! Your **heart rate variability is closely tied to your breathing and is at its highest when your heart rate and breathing synchronize.** It is said that the heart rate and breathing become resonant. This resonance happens when you breathe with the frequency of 0.1 Hz, or about 6 breaths per minute. This is an average number, and it is not the same for everyone. “Each person has a unique resonance frequency (RF) breathing rate, ranging typically between 4.5 and 7.0 breaths/min. In studies of HRV biofeedback, the most common RF breathing rate is 5.5 breaths/min. […] When a person breathes at their identified RF breathing rate, heart rate and breathing become synchronized and the highest levels of HRV are typically obtained.” 

What does all this mean? It means that your **blood pressure, heart rate and respiration become synchronized at about 6 breaths per minute, or 10 seconds per breath**. “A slow respiratory rate (6/min) has generally favorable effects:

 - on cardiovascular and respiratory function 
 - increases respiratory sinus arrhythmia [reflection of higher parasympathetic or rest-and-digest activity] 
 - the arterial baroreflex [which helps to regulate fluctuations in blood pressure] 
 - oxygenation of the blood
 - exercise tolerance
 
 Slow respiration may reduce the deleterious effects of myocardial ischemia, and, in addition, it **increases calmness and wellbeing**. These effects result from, at least in part, synchronization of respiratory and cardiovascular central rhythms. A respiratory rate of around 6/min coincides with and thus augments the 10 second (6/min) Mayer waves.” 

 So those big deep breaths really do pay off :).

This is a recent rigorous study titled, "The Impact of Resonance Frequency Breathing on Measures of Heart Rate Variability, Blood Pressure, and Mood".  Click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5575449/) to reference the source of today's data.

## Action

A great place to start reaping the most of these benefits is to take 10 breaths at this rate daily.  Countless clients I helped in the past adopted this practice and saw dramatic improvements in health to include:
 - decreased anxiety
 - self confidence
 - focus and productivity
 - energy
 - improved sleep

 Wouldn't it be great if there was an app to help us achieve this?..

Well, you're in the right place. Currently I am developing an application called **Stepping Stones**.  This app will not only provide guidance on our optimal breathing rate we discussed, but how many steps we take in a day to maximize our sync between heart and breathe. Not only will the analytics in this app be useful, but the idea of **guided walking meditations** (spoiler: next weeks topic).  This way we have an app that can knock two birds out with one stone.

After all, life is about working smarter and not harder.  That said, check out my latest iOS app, Slapdash Eat, [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slapdash-eat/id1537287785) on the App Store.

Many more udpates to come on health and how my next app Stepping Stones will help us reach our peak!  Cheers.
